# Progress

**Where the work stands, and how it got here.** Written at the end of a working
session by the [`wrap-up`](../.claude/skills/wrap-up/SKILL.md) skill, and read
at the start of the next one.

Two halves, two different guarantees:

- `## Current state` is **current truth**, rewritten in place every session.
  Anything stale here is a bug.
- `## Log` is **history**, prepended newest-first and never edited. Entries are
  true as of their date and go stale by design.

The log says *what* changed and *where it stopped*. It does not say *why* —
that lives in [`journal/`](./journal/), linked from the entry. Neither half is a
spec: [`design/`](./design/) is.

## Current state

**Phase:** Scaffolding complete; the `0.1.0` surface is designed but **no
`enbanc` code exists yet** — `src/enbanc/__init__.py` is a placeholder and
`tests/` holds one placeholder test. The published `0.0.4` on PyPI reserves the
name and nothing more. Settled and binding: the shape of every public type, and
now every way a proceeding can *end*
([`0001`](./decisions/0001-statute-carries-no-model.md) through
[`0012`](./decisions/0012-a-failure-cancels-the-round.md)).
What remains unsettled is the *behaviour* of the proceeding itself — what
advocates see, and what a budget may halt.

**Next up:** Settle **advocate isolation** in
[`design/tribunal.md`](./design/tribunal.md#open-questions) — in round 1, does
an advocate see its peers' arguments, or only the case and statute? It is the
next one to take because it is the last open question that changes what the
system *produces* rather than the shape of a type: isolation yields independent
arguments, visibility yields genuine rebuttal, and a transcript reads
differently under each. Nothing in the settled schemas forces the answer, which
is why it has outlasted the others. Per rule 7, three moves in one commit:
prose into `tribunal.md`, an ADR, then the bullet goes.

**Open questions:**

- The design docs carry their own, and own them:
  [`tribunal.md`](./design/tribunal.md#open-questions) (advocate isolation, cost
  control — now sharpened, with `0011` naming where its answer lands) and
  [`api.md`](./design/api.md#open-questions) (`Case` as base vs. generic,
  per-agent usage, interrogatory id assignment).
- Nothing else outstanding at the project level.

## Log

### 2026-09-02 — streaming, and what happens when there is no verdict

**Did:** Added `hear_stream()` as a live view of the transcript
([`0010`](./decisions/0010-streaming-yields-the-record.md)), then settled how a
proceeding reports *not* ruling. Exhaustion is now a recorded `Undecided`
outcome on `Hearing.outcome`; provider, tool, and validation failures raise
`ProceedingFailed` carrying the partial transcript. `Hearing.ruling` is gone,
and with it the last open question that was blocking a type. Added
[`design/outcomes.md`](./design/outcomes.md) — every ending written out as
concrete values — which is what caught two defects in the schemas above it.

**Stopped at:** Clean. `docs/design/` and the README match the new surface.

**Why this way:**
[`decisions/0010`](./decisions/0010-streaming-yields-the-record.md),
[`decisions/0011`](./decisions/0011-exhaustion-is-an-outcome-failure-is-an-error.md),
and
[`journal/2026-09-02-values-before-schemas.md`](./journal/2026-09-02-values-before-schemas.md)
for why the examples doc found what schema review did not.

**Commits:** `231358c`, `eee4dca`, `3ccdad7`

### 2026-09-02 — the schemas, and six ADRs

**Did:** Took `design/api.md` from a sketch to a full schema spec — verdicts as
a `StrEnum` base, the five filings and their `Entry` envelope, a self-contained
`Transcript`, and `hear()` returning a `Hearing` that wraps the judge's
`Ruling` — and settled six binding pieces as ADRs
[`0004`](./decisions/0004-verdicts-are-a-strenum.md)–[`0009`](./decisions/0009-model-settings-live-on-the-model.md).
Propagated the vocabulary through `design/tribunal.md` and the glossary
(*round*, *filing*, *response*, *entry*, *hearing*), narrowed the
"nothing enters an agent's context" invariant to *nothing from outside itself*
so an advocate's unfiled tool results are legal, and added rule 7 to
`CLAUDE.md` fixing what it takes to resolve an open question.

**Why this way:**
[`decisions/0004`](./decisions/0004-verdicts-are-a-strenum.md)–[`0009`](./decisions/0009-model-settings-live-on-the-model.md);
no journal entry — the only build-time constraint found (Pydantic collapsing a
generic alias parameterized by a bare `TypeVar`) is recorded as spec in
[`design/api.md`](./design/api.md#a-note-on-generic-aliases).

**Commits:** `b8eb899`, `87f6595`, `c363992`, `d4aa820`, `420abc3`, `6934205`,
`96f9615`, `9625fc4`

### 2026-09-01 — the statute is inert; first ADR

**Did:** Settled the first binding piece of the `0.1.0` surface — a `Statute`
carries no model and `Statute.draft()` is cut — and propagated it through
`design/api.md`, the glossary, and the `docs/README.md` index. Sharpened the
journal-vs-ADR split in `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/journal/README.md`, and the `wrap-up`
skill: the journal records how a session went, `decisions/` records what the
project is committed to. Documented in `pyproject.toml` that `uv_build` ships an
allowlist, not everything git tracks — `notes/` and `docs/` stay out of the
sdist only because that section stays bare. Released the `0.0.4` placeholder.

**Stopped at:** Two open questions were dropped into
[`design/api.md`](./design/api.md#open-questions) as raw first-person notes
rather than design prose — the missing `Judge` role, and how `instructions` and
a PydanticAI `Model` are injected into each agent. They need writing up before
they can be settled.

**Why this way:**
[`docs/decisions/0001-statute-carries-no-model.md`](./decisions/0001-statute-carries-no-model.md)

**Commits:** `183fe8a`, `be2b72b`, `045af5a`, `131c94a`, `333b338`, `9b0e08d`,
`e2fa55b`

### 2026-08-29 — documentation structure and the wrap-up skill

**Did:** Established the `docs/` layout and the rules that govern it
(`CLAUDE.md`): `design/` as spec, `decisions/` as immutable ADRs, `journal/` as
dated and stale-by-design, `notes/`/`local/` denied to agents. Added this file
and the `wrap-up` skill that maintains it. Earlier in the day: uv + ruff +
pyright + pytest tooling, pre-commit hooks enforced in CI, the release workflow
with its tag-vs-version check, and the `0.0.3` placeholder release.

**Stopped at:** Clean. `docs/decisions/` and `docs/guides/` are still empty, by
design — nothing has been decided or shipped that needs them.

**Commits:** `f795ae0`, `71ebadc`, `9eb7d33`, `0ea8a40`, `f387674`, `cd05dec`
